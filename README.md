# How To Use Classroom
__GitHub Clasroom__ (_GHC_) is a fairly easy to use system where you can share a base template repository with students; they "accept" the object, and it gets added to their repository, but you automatically have rights to interact with it (for progress monitoring or grading purposes, for example).

## Adding a Template Repo ##
Simply create a repo in the account you have associated with the UPEI Classroom sets - there's a CS organization and Android organization (UPEI-_orgname_), and your classroom will be under one or the other depending on what you're teaching.

## Make an Assignment ##
In GHC lingo, an object a student can accept to work on is called an "Assignment" - even if it's a Lab, a Project, or whatever, it's an "Assignment" in the nomenclature of GHC.

When you do this, you give it a name - this does NOT have to match the name of the template repo (but it often does).  You can define a due date and time for it (so far as I can tell, local to the timezone you're accessing from).  You can decide whether or not it's a cutoff time - but beware, at cutoff time, students can no longer update their repos AT ALL, and you have to go through some hoops to give them back that power.  You can choose if it's individual or team-oriented.

Then, you will specify the repo in _your_ GitHub account as the template, and you can choose whether they have admin privileges on their own repo (this would affect whether they could share or collaborate outside of the classroom).

You can decide what (if any) GitHub editors are available.  Usually, they're pushing updates into a repo that they've developed in something like PyCharm, IntelliJ, Android Studio, or similar.  They are free to link that repo directly to their IDE on their system, if supported.

## Share the Assignment ##
There's a shareable link for the assignment, which when accepted, copies the repo into their own GitHub space, and they can then begin working.  You maintain the ability to access and review their work.

That's basically it.  Not hard at all!
